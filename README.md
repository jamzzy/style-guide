### Introduction

This website was created to practice the html and css concepts learned in Codecademy with the purpose of creating a style guide for a website. This was basically a recreation of the sample given by Codecademy with different fonts and colours I chose. Additionally I attempted to make the webpage continually legible/responsive if the window became smaller than a full screen (ie. the texts and sections didn't overflow over their containers and text doesn't overlap each other).
